# Noita Summoning Expanded
(Steam Workshop) Mod for Noita that adds new monsters and summoning eggs/spells

Each spell can be enabled or disabled in the mod settings. But the eggs will always be added to the item spawn list

This mod also tweaks the charm effect gfx to be a little less overwhelming by slightly decreasing the size & lifetime
